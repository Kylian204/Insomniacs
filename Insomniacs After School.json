  "description": "Nakami is a studious but cranky and antisocial high schooler who gets on his classmates' nerves. However, his bad attitude comes from the fact that he has a sleeping disorder, and frequently spends nights on end without a single minute of sleep. During the preparations for the school festival, he is begrudgingly sent to the school's astronomy observatory to gather cardboard boxes, a place which is said to be haunted by the dire happenings of the now defunct Astronomy Club. He finds the isolated place a haven ripe for him to sleep, but while rummaging around, he stumbles upon his classmate Magari Isaki sleeping inside a toppled-over locker.\n\nIsaki, unlike him, is a personable and popular girl at class, but who also hides her own problems with insomnia. Looking for a middle ground, they find that there's comfort and ease in sleeping together, so they resort to make the observatory their own private cubby to sleep… Have they found the comfort they're looking for?\n\nOfficial Raws\nhttps://bigcomics.jp/series/540e00b7bca49\nBook Walker\nhttps://bookwalker.jp/series/218411/list\nAmazon JP\nhttps://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B084Z324Z2\nebookJapan\nhttps://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/558515/\nCDJapan\nhttps://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-2687531\nViz Media\nhttps://www.viz.com/insomniacs-after-school",
